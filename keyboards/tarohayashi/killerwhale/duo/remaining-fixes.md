- Disable automouse, make mouse active while you hold key

- change tap-hold: I_ESC's hold action must trigger on 130ms timeout expire, not on release

- figure out what to do with numbers. Changing to a separate layer to use numbers\arrows is not really 
  convenient. First solutions should probably be combos or momentary toggle

- bring three combos (copy and select) from moonlander

- fix a `ni` issue (nullify timer)

## You are here

- find a transistor and pray my button will work, so I can shift QAZ column one down (author was correct,
  I should not have raised the column for no reason lol. Chesterton's fence).

- maybe rebind ctrl + h to backspace entirely?

- one more iteration of unifying symbols on two languages
