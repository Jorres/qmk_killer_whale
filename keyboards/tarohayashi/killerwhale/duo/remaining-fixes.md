- Disable automouse, make mouse active while you hold key

- change tap-hold: I_ESC's hold action must trigger on 130ms timeout expire, not on release

- figure out what to do with numbers. Changing to a separate layer to use numbers\arrows is not really 
  convenient. First solutions should probably be combos or momentary toggle

- bring three combos (copy and select) from moonlander

- fix a `ni` issue (nullify timer)

- enable scroll mode on dpad press and hold

- moving language select this far is a bad move

- enable f11 (kitty expansion as a consequence)

- change mouse button to a combo of three

- for japanese, enable selecting a language accurately, like on moonlander. Combo invocation of LGUI does not seem to work

## Not flashed

## You are here

- maybe rebind ctrl + h to backspace entirely? - unfortunately, ctrl + h has a meaning (in vim mainly) and will have 
  to stay ctrl-h. I don't have means in my keyboard to know what Vim mode am I currently in.
  just rebind in lua if the problem is with neovim only?

- find a transistor and pray my button will work, so I can shift QAZ column one down (author was correct,
  I should not have raised the column for no reason lol. Chesterton's fence).

- combo of three doesn't really feel good. I would like just a less frequent combo of two.

- under the middle finger on numbers layer do some more often used shift + left\right arrow combinations. 
  specifically used for messages and selecting text.

## Think a bit harder

- one more iteration of unifying symbols on two languages
